## Mount a `LVM` in linux.
  - Connect the drive
  - run the command `lvm`
    - Inside the `lvm` terminal
    - `pvscan` <- (note the PV name)
    - `lvscan` <- (note the LV names)
    - `lvchange -ay /dev/{pv-name-here}` eg ` lvchange -ay /dev/fedora_a/home`
  - Now mount the dive with that name: `sudo mount /dev/fedora_a/home /tmp/fed24/`
  - Here the drive is ready for use in `/tmp/fed24`

#### Commands:
`pvs`:
     pvs — report information about physical volumes

To mount use the regular procedure:

1. Create a directory
    `mkdir HD_Laptopo`
2. Mount as a regular partion
    `mount mount /dev/vg_<host>/lv_home ./HD_Laptopo`

#### Command line open image from console for gnome:
`eog <path to image>`

#### Get disply settings in console:
`xdpyinfo`

Get the display size:
`xdpyinfo | grep dim`

#### Call the configured service to open a specific file:
`xdg-open <path to file>

```
### Go to sleep:

### Complicated way to write files when there's no editor.

```
$ cat > filename.txt
write stuff
other stuff
and so on

##### `setuid` and `setgid`

`setuid` and `setgid` are Unix access rights flags that allow users to run an executable with the permissions of the executable's owner or group respectively and to change behaviour in directories.

### Using `/etc/skel` (skel = skeleton?)

The `/etc/skel` is a directory used by the command `useradd` to create
the default settings in a new user's home directory.

```
roor@pc/etc/skel#ls -a
. .. .bashrc .profile
```

The settings for the command `useradd` can be changed by editing
`/etc/default/useradd`


## `wget` in windows

To get files available via http:
```
cmd > ps
:: in power shell is an alias for Invoke-WebRequest
wget https://www.example.com -OutFile out.html
:: for older PS versions
Invoke-WebRequest http://www.google.com/ -OutFile c:\google.html
```
